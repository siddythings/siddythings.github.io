Hii, I know your preparing for your interview, So here I m to help you to list down some of the most common questions asked in the interview.


<!--more-->
This series you will hear a lot of questions about an array in any coding interviews.

The benefit of an array data structure is that it offers fast  O(1) search by index, but adding and removing an element from an array is slow because ones you create an array you cannot change it.

## Few things you should know about Array.
- Arrays are zero-indexed means it starts from 0.
- An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Searching by index in the array is O(1) but insert and delete is not easy because you may need to re-arrange the array.
- Arrays allow random access of elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
- Array Questions from Coding Interviews.

## Here are some of the most common array-based questions asked in the interviews.
